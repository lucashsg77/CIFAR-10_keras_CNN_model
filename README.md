# CIFAR 10 keras CNN model
 It's a simple python project with some keras CNN models and a GUI interface for selecting a keras model and testing the model to classify an image

# Usage
 For training a new model you simply need to run the train_model.py file, but if you want to change the setting for the training you need to go and modify it of course, in the way it is now the model has a 80%+ accurracy and since I don't own a Nvidia GPU it takes a while to train the model for more than 50 epochs.

# Considerations
 I just started studying ML and Deep learning so the code itself is not perfect nor optimized to the fullest but feel free to improve it!
